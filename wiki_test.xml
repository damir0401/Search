Students extend their program-design skills while learning multiple data 
structures, common graph algorithms, different forms of societal impacts from 
programs, how to analyze programs for performance, and how to work effectively 
with multiple styles of programming languages. Examples and course projects 
draw from several areas of computer science to help students identify their 
broader interests within the field. There will be a required weekly lab session
 involving hands-on work with course material.
Prerequisite: CSCI 0112, CSCI 0150, 0170, or CSCI 0190. In addition, CSCI 0111 
can be used with both additional work and the instructor's permission. The 
first two weeks of the course will be taught as at least two parallel tracks 
based on which prerequisite course a student has taken.
CSCI 0200 will be offered every semester (fall and spring).

Techniques for designing, building, and maintaining large,scalable, and reusable
 systems. We will cover advanced programming techniques using Java and 
 Javascript. Course assignments will familiarize students with software testing,
  relational databases, concurrency techniques such as threads, and software 
  engineering tools like git, profilers, and debuggers. A major component of the
   course will be a group software project of your own design.

Prerequisite: CSCI 0160, CSCI 0180, CSCI 0190, or CSCI 0200; CSCI 0220 is 
recommended.

High-level computer architecture and systems programming. The course covers the 
organization of computer systems (in terms of storage units, caches, processors,
 and I/O controllers) and teaches students assembly-language programming and 
 C-language programming. Extensive programming exercises introduce students to 
 systems-level programming on Unix systems, as well as to multi-threaded 
 programming with POSIX threads. Students will be introduced to the functions of
  operating systems. Prerequisite: CSCI 0160, 0180, 0190, or 0200.
